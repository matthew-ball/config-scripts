#+TITLE: Configuration Script
#+AUTHOR: Mathew Ball

* Introduction
- This configuration project is a work in progress. It attempts to create an environment which is consistent across systems and easily set up.

** Git Branches
- The *laptop* branch represents the /unstable/ configuration[fn:development].
- The *desktop* branch represents the /stable/ configuration.
- The *server* branch represents the /minimal/ configuration[fn:current].

* ~configuration script~ :: server branch
This configuration project represents the /minimal/ configuration for the ~configuration script~ project. /describe more/.

** Configuration Files
- This configuration should be stored in a single directory; the configuration can be put on [[https://github.com/][github]] (or another service) and pulled/pushed as required.
- The script [[file:config-setup.sh][config-setup.sh]] (which should have been distributed with this file) will install the configuration project - that is, will establish the necessary symbolic links. This script should be run from the configuration scripts project root directory, and it ought to be agnostic to the underlying architecture; though it has primarily been developed on a =debian= install.
- The following list is of the files to be linked:
  |----------------------+---------------+------------------------------------------|
  | Source:              | Destination:  | Command:                                 |
  |----------------------+---------------+------------------------------------------|
  | emacs-dir/           | ~/.emacs.d/   | ln -s emacs-dir ~/.emacs.d               |
  | irssi-dir/           | ~/.irssi/     | ln -s irssi-dir ~/.irssi                 |
  |----------------------+---------------+------------------------------------------|
  | bash-dir/init.sh     | ~/.bashrc     | ln -s bash-dir/init.sh ~/.bashrc         |
  | bash-dir/profile.sh  | ~/._profile    | ln -s bash-dir/profile.sh ~/._profile     |
  | xinit-dir/session.sh | ~/.xsessionrc | ln -s xinit-dir/session.sh ~/.xsessionrc |
  | screen-dir/init.sh   | ~/.screenrc   | ln -s screen-dir/init.sh ~/.screenrc     |
  |----------------------+---------------+------------------------------------------|

** Default Applications
- The following applications are assumed /default/ for this configuration to take effect:
  1. GNU Emacs (24.4.1)
  2. GNU Screen (4.02.01)
  3. irssi (0.8.17)

* Footnotes
[fn:development] Main development is done on the laptop, when a configuration is considered "stable" it is merged with the desktop branch. The server branch is a clone of the desktop branch with certain features removed.
[fn:current] This is the current branch.
