#+TITLE: Configuration Script
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Ball

* Introduction
- This configuration project is a work in progress. It attempts to create an environment which is consistent across systems and easily set up.

** Git Branches
- The *laptop* branch represents the /unstable/ configuration[fn:development-and-current].
- The *desktop* branch represents the /stable/ configuration.
- The *server* branch represents the /minimal/ configuration.

* ~configuration script~ :: laptop branch
This configuration project /essentially/ replaces xfwm4 with StumpWM under an XFCE environment. The base system used in the development has been Debian Squeeze/Wheezy/Jessie but presumably it should be independent of specific GNU/Linux distribution (and indeed, desktop environment); the configuration represents a possible "desktop" shell for GNU environments; ideally this "shell" will work across multiple distributions.

I describe this as "essentially" for the reason that, to use this configuration effectively, it is desirable that you use GNU Emacs, of course, it's not /impossible/ to use the configuration without it, but it does make certain things easier. As such, this configuration is designed primarily to maximize the use, and work-flow, of GNU Emacs. With this in mind, this configuration creates a simple distraction-free desktop environment. To cater to this demand, the window manager StumpWM was chosen; StumpWM is a /tiling/ window manager (although, it offers /floating/ window management too).

The configuration sets up an effective working system; unique workstations for each task - editing, browsing, misc, etc - which launch applications to specific workstations. This is a paradigm shift in window management, with an emphasis on focusing on tasks.

- The ~session.sh~ file (which is linked to [[file:~/.xsessionrc][~/.xsessionrc]]) sets environment variables which are read by GNU Emacs, BASH, and the StumpWM window manager[fn:login] as the /default/ applications.

** Configuration Files
- This configuration should be stored in a single directory; the configuration can be put on github (or another service) and pulled/pushed as required.
- The script ~config-setup.sh~ (which should have been distributed with this file) will install the configuration project - that is, will establish the necessary symbolic links. This script should be run from the configuration scripts project root directory, and it ought to be agnostic to the underlying architecture; though it has primarily been developed on a ~debian~ install.
- The following list of files is to be linked:

*** GNOME Desktop Manager
- The following command: =sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove= removes gdm from the boot process.
- To start GDM manually: =sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start=
- To restore defaults: =sudo update-rc.d gdm defaults=

*** XFCE Desktop Manager
- The following command:
- To start LightDM manually:
- To restore defaults:

** TODO Create a =mailconfig= file for handling the email configuration
- symlink to ~/.authinfo
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
     machine imap.gmail.com login user-primary-email-address port 993
     machine smtp.gmail.com login user-primary-email-address port 587
   #+END_SRC

** TODO create personal dictionary from ~/home/chu/.aspell.en.pws~
* Footnotes
[fn:development-and-current] Main development is done on the laptop, when a configuration is (arbitrarily) considered "stable" it is merged with the desktop branch. This is the current branch.
[fn:login] This is actually read by the LightDM process upon logging into the XFCE environment.
