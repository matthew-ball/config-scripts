* The =GNU Emacs= configuration
- This is an attempt at the full blown "=GNU Emacs= as an Operating System" configuration.
  + Not all of the configuration needs to be used[fn:configuration-note], but it is recommended.

** [[file:init.el][Initiation]]
- This file initialises the configuration:
  + Defines two customisation groups: [[elisp:(customize-group%20user-variables)][user-variables]] and [[elisp:(customize-group%20'user-directories)][user-directories]].
    - Each customisation group includes a number of variables.
  + Sets the user details (name and email address).
  + Requires common-lisp library.
  + Define a macro [[file:init.el::(defmacro%20after%20(mode%20&rest%20body)][after]] which loads the body code after its argument file (syntactic sugar over [[help:eval-after-load][eval-after-load]]).
  + Modifies the load-path.
  + Modifies the info-path.
  + Initiate emacs package manager.
  + Define function [[file:init.el::(defun%20use-config-file%20(name)][use-config-file]] to load in an elisp library.
  + Requires specific configuration files[fn:order-of-evaluation]:
    - *appearance-config*
    - *general-config*
    - *user-config*
    - *writing-config*
    - *programming-config*
    - *key-bindings-config*
  + The [[file:init.el][init.el]] file also provides the user with the command `[[file:init.el::%3B%3B%3B%20COMMENT:%20shutdown%20emacs%20server][server-shutdown]]':
    - This will save any (modified) buffers, save the emacs daemon process, and kill the server.
  + Sets custom configuration file.

*** [[file:config-el/package-config.el][package-config.el]]
- This file provides a configuration for packages not available by default in =GNU Emacs=.
  + The following files[fn:auto-setup] are installed from the =ELPA= package manager[fn:ELPA]:
    - The following list are the necessary packages; the =core-packages=:
      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        (setq core-packages
              (list 'diminish 'color-theme 'smex 'zenburn 'paredit 'ido-ubiquitous))
      #+end_src

    - The following list are the user choice packages; the =user-packages=:
      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        (setq user-packages
              (list 'emms 'eproject 'fill-column-indicator 'magit 'gh 'gist 'c-eldoc 'haskell-mode))
      #+end_src

    - diminish :: /description/
    - color-theme :: /description/
    - smex :: /description/
    - zenburn :: just some alien fruit salad to keep you in the zone
    - paredit :: minor mode for pseudo-structurally editing Lisp code
    - ido-ubiquitous :: use `ido-completing-read' instead of `completing-read'
    - c-eldoc :: /description/
    - fill-column-indicator :: /description/
    - gh :: /description/
    - gist :: /description/
    - eproject :: /description/
    - haskell-mode :: /description/
    - magit :: /description/

  + The following files are not available from =ELPA=, but are required for complete working:
    - auto-complete :: auto-complete functionality - available from [[http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/][cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/]] (not available in =ELPA=)
    - apt-mode :: debian/ubuntu package management - available from [[http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/downloads/list.cgi#apt-el][netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/downloads/list.cgi#apt-el]]
    - ...

 + The setup has a =run-initial-setup= function:
   -This function downloads the custom packages from =ELPA= (WARNING: Internet connection required.)

- This file includes an interface to the system package manager ...

** [[file:config-el/appearance-config.el][Appearance]]
- This file provides a configuration for visual appearance:
  + Sets the colour theme to =zenburn= theme[fn:requires-zenburn].

** General
*** Dired Settings :: [[file:config-el/dired-config.el][dired-config.el]]
- This file provides a configuration for =dired=:
  + ...

** User
*** ERC Settings :: [[file:config-el/erc-config.el][erc-config.el]]
- This file provides a configuration for =ERC= (the GNU Emacs IRC Client):
  + ...

*** GNUS Settings :: [[file:config-el/gnus-config.el][gnus-config.el]]
- This file provides a configuration for =GNUS= (the GNU Emacs Mail and News Reader):
  + ...

** Writing
*** Organisation Settings :: [[file:config-el/org-config.el][org-config.el]]
#+begin_quote
Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing project planning with a fast and effective plain text system.
#+end_quote

- This will be by *far* the largest section in this README file, but unless you are already well-versed in =org-mode= functionality and terminology, it is /very/ strongly recommend you read over it.

- This file provides a configuration for =org-mode=:
  + ...

- The ultimate idea is to write a "literate" configuration script - using GNU Emacs and =org-mode=.

*** LaTeX Settings :: [[file:config-el/latex-config.el][latex-config.el]]
- This file provides a configuration for =LaTeX=:
  + ...

** [[file:config-el/programming-config.el][Programming]]
# ===UPDATE===
- This file provides a configuration for the following programming modes:
  + =emacs-lisp= Programming
  + =common-lisp= Programming
  + =haskell= Programming
  + =python= Programming
  + =slime=
  + =maxima=

** [[file:config-el/key-bindings-config.el][Key Bindings]]
- This file provides a configuration for key bindings:
  + ...

* Footnotes

[fn:ELPA] GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archiver.

[fn:auto-setup] This still needs to be correctly configured.

[fn:subjective] Obviously this is going to be subjective. This configuration presented here is very much based around /my/ preferences.

[fn:requires-zenburn] This *requires* the zenburn theme as an outside extra (available from ELPA).

[fn:order-of-evaluation] The order these files are listed in is the order they are included in. This ordering may (or may not) be necessary.

[fn:external] The word "external" in this context means something like "acting outside the traditional scope of a text-editor".

[fn:configuration-note] This should be verified.
