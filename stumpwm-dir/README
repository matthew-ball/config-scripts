* The =StumpWM= configuration
This is an attempt at a full blown desktop environment using XFCE in combination with StumpWM.

This configuration extends the default StumpWM behaviour.

** Applications
StumpWM has a powerful "run-or-raise" system for dealing with application frames.

** Mode Line
StumpWM features a minimal mode-line as a replacement for the more feature-ful panels found in desktop environments. However, StumpWM is compatible with the aforementioned desktop panels if the mode-line is not sufficient.
